wscat -c ws://localhost:10000/test/services/stomp/ -H "Host: localhost:10000" -H "Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13" -H "Upgrade: websocket" -H "Authorization: Basic dGVzdDp0ZXN0Cg=="
```

Not working (through gravitee):

```
wscat -c ws://localhost:8082/test/services/stomp/ -H "Host: localhost:8082" -H "Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13" -H "Upgrade: websocket" -H "Authorization: Basic dGVzdDp0ZXN0Cg=="
